<h1 align="center">0x00. AirBnB clone - The console.</h1>

The console is the first segment of the AirBnB project at ALX that 
will collectively cover fundamental concepts of higher level programming. 
The goal of AirBnB project is to eventually deploy our server a simple copy 
of the AirBnB Website(HBnB). A command interpreter is created in this segment 
to manage objects for the AirBnB(HBnB) website.
